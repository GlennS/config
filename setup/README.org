* Computer Setup
A Guix installation for a work machine.

Requires a Debian base, and access to my .ssh keys.

You'd need to modify it to use your own ssh setup.

** How to use
You can type the first steps in manually unless you can get this repository on there.

** Steps
First run [[file:initial.sh][initial setup]].

Then run [[file:ssh-setup.sh][ssh setup]].

At this point, you can get this repository down if you don't have it already:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:GlennS/config.git;
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak;
  sudo cp apt-sources-contrib-nonfree.list /etc/apt/sources.list;
  sudo aptitude update;
#+END_SRC

If running in VirtualBox: [[http://virtualboxes.org/doc/installing-guest-additions-on-debian][install VirtualBox guest extensions]]. Don't install the 'virtualbox-guest-additions-iso' package, which is actually for a host machine.

Then run [[file:guix.sh][Guix setup]].

Then run config setup?
